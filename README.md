<h1 align="center"><strong>Viewture Front End Technical Test</strong></h1>

[View the live project here](https://josecastanocoding.github.io/viewture-front-end-technical-test/)

This is a recreation of an image provided by Viewture in an HTML page.
The focus, as per the instructions, is on the general HTML/CSS styling, such as page structure, colours, layout organisation. 

Form functionality hasn't been built. Viewture does not expect the form to work, as this is a purely front-end task. Fonts are not needed either.

Thank you,<br>
